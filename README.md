# Weather-Dashboard
Weather dashboard utilizing API's

## Description

* I aimed to create a weather dashboard application utilizing weather API's.
* The application allows users to search for a desired city and presents them with the current conditions for the day aswell as a 5 day forecast.
* This application also features local storage to save previous searches and displays the last city searched showing current conditions and a 5 day forecast.

## Objectives
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Features

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the  humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
* WHEN I open the weather dashboard
* THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
